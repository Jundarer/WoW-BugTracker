## How to create a good Bug Report?

If your bug report is effective, chances are higher that it will get fixed quickly. So fixing a bug depends on how effectively it's reported.

### 1) Reproducible:

If your bug is not reproducible it will be hard to fix it. You should clearly try to **provide the steps to reproduce the bug**.
Do not assume or skip any reproducing step. A step-by-step description of the issue is easy to reproduce and therefore fix.

### 2) Specific:

Do not write an essay about the problem. **Be specific and to the point**. Try to summarize the problem in minimum words yet in effective way.
Do not combine multiple problems even if they seem to be similar.
Write different reports for each problem.

### 3) Environment Details:

If your bug seems to be related to your setup, **include some informations about it**.

### 4) Labels:

Several labels are available, **you should use them** in order to reduce the amount of work to process the report.

### 5) Duplicate:

Before opening any report, you should do a quick research to **see if your bug isn't already reported**.
If you have additionnal informations about it, please comment the already opened issue.
